.B Formats

If
.B _printf
if it detects a %, but does not contain a format (besides not being alone, in
that case is Error), it will print as if it were a string.
This version of _printf is able to identify the following formats:

%c     The argument is printed as a character and return 1.

%s     The argument is printed as a string and return string length.

%%     Print a percent and return 1.

%d     The argument is printed as a decimal number and return number length.

%i     The argument is printed as a decimal number and return number length.

%b     The argument is converted and printed in binary form and return number
length.

%r     The argument is printed backwards and return string length.

.B _printf
uses some functions created in Holberton and others of its own for its operation
such as: _strlen, _strcat, rev_string, _putchar, among others.
